Data Wrangling and Linear Modeling with COVID-19 data
● Created a program that wrangles Covid confirmed cases, deaths, hospital
beds, and demographics data into a joined dataset of one table
● Used different combinations of variables for modeling
● Ensured the correct evaluation metric was used
● Displayed plotted evaluation metrics of the different models
